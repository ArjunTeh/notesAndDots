* Intro Notes
  The broad question here is whether or not these monte carlo sampling techniques used in rendering are useful in physical simulation realm.
  Supposedly, we can take a global system and only sample parts of it to see if maybe there exists an adaptive way to sample these problems.

* Ideas
  It may be worth taking inspiration from adaptive techniques and instead of LOD use sampling techniques to get the necessary information.
